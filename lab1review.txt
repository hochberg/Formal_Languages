Both essays respond and address the question correctly. Good job!

The DFA looks ok.

You could use $\Sigma$ more to save some space. Lets say that you want to make
an arrow if the next symbol is not an 'f', you could simply say $\{\Sigma - f\}$,
which means the set of all possible symbols of the whole alphabet minus 'f'.

You need to specify on a foot note what do you mean by this ¶, even though it
may seem obvious to you or me.
