Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the correct format.

- The program was supposed to run as follows:
$ java driverDFA gncgwng
but your program runs as:
$ java ManWolf < input.txt 
which is not what was indicated in the handout.


Style:

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and ManWolf files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Good block comments


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.


CSV files:

- State-transition table looks good.

- Usually the description of states only includes the state and its
  corresponding description; a description of what it means to be in that
  state.
